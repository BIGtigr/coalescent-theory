    If $Y = a + bX$, $E[X] = \mu $ and $Var(X) = \sigma^2$, then 

    \begin{align*}
        E[Y] &= E[a + bX] \\
             &= a + b \cdot E[X] \\
             &= a + b\mu
    \end{align*}

    \begin{align*}
        Var[Y] &= Var[a + bX] \\
               &= Var[bX] \\
               &= b^2 \cdot Var[X] \\
               &= b^2 \sigma^2
    \end{align*}

A heads is more likely to be flipped before a 2 is rolled:  the chance of
getting a head is $\sfrac{1}{2}$, which is greater than $\sfrac{1}{6}$, the
chance of rolling a 2.

The number of times we flip a coin before a 6 is rolled is geometrically
distributed with parameter $p = 1/6$.  Therefore, the expected number of times
we flip a coin is $\frac{1}{p} = 6$, and since we expect half of those trials to
be tails, the expected number of tails before a 6 is rolled is 3.

    \subsection*{X}

    First, we find the distribution of X, the minimum of n independent
    exponential random variables $E_1 \dots E_n$:

    \begin{align*}
            F_X(t) &= P(\text{min}(E_1, \dots, E_n) \le t) \\
        1 - F_X(t) &= P(\text{min}(E_1, \dots, E_n) > t) \\
                   &= P(E_1 > t \land \dots \land E_n > t) \\
                   &= \prod_{i=1}^n P(E_i > t) \\
                   &= \prod_{i=1}^n 1 - F_i(t) \\
                   &= \prod_{i=1}^n e^{-\mu_i t} \\
                   &= e^{-(\sum_{i=1}^n\mu_i) t} \\
            F_X(t) &= 1 - e^{-(\sum_{i=1}^n\mu_i) t} \\
            f_X(t) &= (\sum_{i=1}^n\mu_i) e^{-(\sum_{i=1}^n\mu_i) t}
    \end{align*}

    Which is the same as an exponential random variable with $\mu =
    \sum_{i=1}^n\mu_i$

    \subsection*{Y}

    Next, we find the distribution of Y, the maximum of n independent
    exponential random variables $E_1 \dots E_n$,

    \begin{align*}
            F_X(t) &= P(\text{max}(E_1, \dots, E_n) \le t) \\
                   &= P(E_1 \le t \land \dots \land E_n \le t) \\
                   &= \prod_{i=1}^n P(E_i \le t) \\
                   &= \prod_{i=1}^n F_i(t) \\
                   &= \prod_{i=1}^n (1 - e^{-\mu_i t})
    \end{align*}

    Which fully describes the distribution, but is not differentiable without a
    fixed n.  However, if the exponential random variables are identically
    distributed with parameter $\mu'$, we get additionally,
    \begin{align*}
            F_X(t) &= \prod_{i=1}^n (1 - e^{-\mu' t}) \\
                   &= (1 - e^{-\mu' t})^n \\
            f_X(t) &= n (1 - e^{-\mu' t})^{n-1} \cdot \mu' e^{-\mu' t}
    \end{align*}


\section{}

    If both parents are heterozygous, the probability of a healthy child being
    homozygous for the normal allele is $\sfrac{1}{3}$.  Of the four possible
    outcomes from the parents, one is removed because we know the child is
    healthy, two result in a heterozygous child, and one results in a homozygous
    normal child.

    If one parent is homozygous and the other is heterozygous, then the child
    will always inherit one normal allele from its homozygous normal parent, so
    the chance of being homozygous normal is the chance of inheriting the normal
    allele from the heterozygous parent, and is $\sfrac{1}{2}$.

The observed heterozygosity after 20 generations is usually 0, but occasionally
non-zero, as this graph demonstrates.  This is expected, since under this model
heterozygosity should decline exponentially, on average, and since the
population is small, it should decline rapidly.

With a larger population, heterozygosity wanders, but much more slowly than it
did with 10 individuals, as expected.

Simulating 20 individuals for 1 million generations took 58.768 seconds on my
desktop, using a 2.8 GHz processor, including the output formatting.
